# Fear Woods - Survival Horror Game

## Description

Our game, Fear Woods, is about surviving in a spooky forest and fixing your car to escape a monster. The game happens on a dark, lonely road that makes you feel all alone. It's all about staying alive and avoiding the monster, giving you a real scare as if something is chasing you.

The whole point of Fear Woods is to make you feel the thrill of being scared and having to be smart to stay safe. You have to move through the dark woods, using your flashlight carefully because the battery doesn't last forever. This makes the game more exciting because you have to think about when to use your light.

You need to stay away from the monster by being quiet, hiding, and moving sneakily. We made the game simple on purpose, so it's more about the rush of trying to get away and the joy of getting your car working again to escape. We want everyone to enjoy the game, whether you like simple goals or the excitement of almost getting caught by the monster.

Fear Woods is different because it's simple but still very scary. It's about using smart strategies to explore and not getting caught. We promise it'll be a game full of suspense and scares, but also the great feeling of getting away in the end.
